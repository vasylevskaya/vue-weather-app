[DEMO]

Weather App built with Vue

- By default, it shows the weather for the user's current location. If the user doesn't allow access to their location, they can use a search input to retrieve weather data for a specific location.
- It fetches real data from an API and provides information about the current temperature, UV index, wind, humidity, cloud cover, precipitation, visibility, and pressure.
- It displays the location on a map.
- The background changes according to whether it's day or night, as well as the intensity of cloud cover.
